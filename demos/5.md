can you help me create a n8n workflow and deploy the workflow to my n8n instance.
i want the workflow to be that i want to read every message in the HELP channel of our teams environment and for that question i want to start a research to help this person. so i want a number of AI agents all doing a search in different ways to find the answer and all send this to 1 agnet that will look through all the proposed answers and create 1 final answer and send that back to the teams channel.
leave all authentication things open i'll do that myself. If you need LLM capabilities use azure models.
